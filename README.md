# LAB-probiotic-evaluation-framework
The constraint-based modeling framework provided here is an extension of FBAwMC (Beg et al. 2007), which accurately predicts the phenotypic behavior of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) under different in silico dietary regimes. In silico diet constraints were adopted from the work of Noronha et al. 2019.
